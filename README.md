## About This Project
This project basically features a Server and a Client program that has a CLI to use it. The client can connect to the server and the server can handle more than one client at a time. Clients can send requests to the server and get the response. The server can broadcast message to all the clients that are connected to it. The server also maintains logs of the events in a text file. This is built using socket programming and threads in Java.

Here are some screenshots of the running program.
